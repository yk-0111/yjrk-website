    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I first got hooked on the overlap between art and technology during an AR class, 
        just before the pandemic made those questions impossible to ignore. 
        Since then, Iâ€™ve been focused on how systems shape creative work and how we can build better ones.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I started in arts administration, where I often had to create the tools that werenâ€™t there. 
        It gave me a front-row seat to how museums operate and how much can change when you rethink the foundation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My thesis explored NFTs through the lens of ownership, copyright, and the blurred lines between value and meaning. 
        It combined tech, policy, and philosophy, and shaped how I think about culture today.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Right now, my focus is on fundraising and development. 
        I believe museums need new modelsâ€”less reliant on grants, more aligned with how people engage now.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I work where art, technology, and structure meet. Thatâ€™s where the change happens and thatâ€™s where I plan to be.</p>
